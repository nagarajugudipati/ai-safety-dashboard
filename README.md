1. how to build/install dependencies and run your project locally:
   To run the project locally, first clone the repository using git clone and navigate into the project directory.
   Once inside, install all required dependencies by running the command npm install. After the installation is complete, start the development server using the command npm start.
   The application will then compile and automatically open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000. If it does not open automatically, you can manually navigate to that address.
   This will allow you to interact with the project locally in development mode.


   
2.  The language/framework:
    The project is built using JavaScript and the React framework. It was created using create-react-app with JavaScript as the primary language.
    Styling is done with CSS, using Flexbox and Grid for layout design.
    Dependency management is handled through npm.
